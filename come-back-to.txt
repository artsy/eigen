Complicated React 19 type errors to come back to later:

1. src/app/Navigation/AuthenticatedRoutes/Tabs.tsx(198,28): error TS2345: Argument of type 'EventArg<"tabPress", true, undefined>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent>'.
   - Issue: React Navigation event type mismatch with React Native event handler
   - The handleTabPress function expects NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent> but receives EventArg from React Navigation
   - Complex because it involves changing how tab press events are handled in navigation
   - Need to investigate proper React Navigation event handling patterns
