Complicated React 19 type errors to come back to later:

1. src/app/Navigation/AuthenticatedRoutes/Tabs.tsx(198,28): error TS2345: Argument of type 'EventArg<"tabPress", true, undefined>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent>'.
   - Issue: React Navigation event type mismatch with React Native event handler
   - The handleTabPress function expects NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent> but receives EventArg from React Navigation
   - Complex because it involves changing how tab press events are handled in navigation
   - Need to investigate proper React Navigation event handling patterns

2. src/app/Scenes/Favorites/Favorites.tsx(169,13): error TS2322: Type 'FC<MaterialTopTabBarProps>' is not assignable to type '(props: MaterialTopTabBarProps) => ReactNode'.
   - Issue: React 19 FC type is stricter about return types (can return Promise<ReactNode>)
   - The tabBar prop expects a function returning ReactNode but FC can return ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>
   - Dangerous to cast - need to investigate proper React 19 FC patterns for navigation components
   - May need to change FavoritesHeaderTapBar from FC to regular function component

3. src/app/Scenes/InfiniteDiscovery/Components/InfiniteDiscoveryArtworkCard.tsx(191,13): error TS2322: Type '{ readonly " $fragmentSpreads": FragmentRefs<"ArtistListItem_artist">; } | null | undefined' is not assignable to type '_FragmentRefs<"ArtistListItem_artist">'.
   - Issue: Relay fragment nullable issue with artwork.artists?.[0]
   - Conditional rendering causes linter issues
   - Need proper pattern for handling nullable Relay fragments in JSX without linter conflicts

4. src/app/Scenes/OrderHistory/OrderDetail/Components/OrderDetailBuyerProtection.tsx(22,6): error TS2322: Type '{ children: Element; variant: "default"; containerStyle: { px: 1; }; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & MessageProps'.
   - Issue: Message component in React 19 doesn't accept children prop
   - The Message component usage pattern has changed in React 19
   - Need to investigate new Message component API or use alternative approach
   - Complex because it affects component functionality and requires understanding new patterns

5. src/app/Scenes/Inbox/Components/Conversations/Message.tsx(115,20): error TS2322: Type '{ children: Element; onPress: (url: string) => Promise<void>; linkStyle: { color: string; textDecorationLine: "underline"; }; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & IntrinsicClassAttributes<HyperLink> & Readonly<Props>'.
   - Issue: HyperLink component in React 19 doesn't accept children prop  
   - The Hyperlink component usage pattern has changed in React 19
   - Need to investigate new Hyperlink component API or use alternative text/link components
   - Complex because it affects link functionality in message components

6. src/app/Scenes/MyCollection/MyCollectionArtworks.tsx(93,11): error TS2322: Type '{ contextScreenOwnerType: OwnerType; contextScreenOwnerId: any; contextScreenOwnerSlug: any; artwork: any; height: number; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & MappedFragmentProps<...>'.
   - Issue: Component receiving props not defined in interface (contextScreenOwnerType, contextScreenOwnerId, etc.)
   - MyCollectionArtworkGridItemProps only accepts 'artwork' but component called with additional props
   - Need to either update component interface to accept these props or refactor calling code
   - Complex because it might affect tracking/analytics functionality
