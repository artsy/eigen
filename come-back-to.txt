Complicated React 19 type errors to come back to later:

1. src/app/Navigation/AuthenticatedRoutes/Tabs.tsx(198,28): error TS2345: Argument of type 'EventArg<"tabPress", true, undefined>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent>'.
   - Issue: React Navigation event type mismatch with React Native event handler
   - The handleTabPress function expects NativeSyntheticEvent<TouchEvent> but receives EventArg from React Navigation
   - Complex because it involves changing how tab press events are handled in navigation
   - Need to investigate proper React Navigation event handling patterns

2. src/app/Scenes/Favorites/Favorites.tsx(169,13): error TS2322: Type 'FC<MaterialTopTabBarProps>' is not assignable to type '(props: MaterialTopTabBarProps) => ReactNode'.
   - Issue: React 19 FC type is stricter about return types (can return Promise<ReactNode>)
   - The tabBar prop expects a function returning ReactNode but FC can return ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>
   - Dangerous to cast - need to investigate proper React 19 FC patterns for navigation components
   - May need to change FavoritesHeaderTapBar from FC to regular function component
