### Welcome to the Emission Beta

#### Artsy Emission Beta Sign-up

To get started, click here: [artsy-eigen-beta-boarding.herokuapp.com](http://artsy-eigen-beta-boarding.herokuapp.com) ( ideally open it in another window, so you can read this too.)

This will re-direct you to this Artsy login, where you should log in with your `[me]@artsymail.com` account.

</p>

Signing in to this gives us a chance to ensure that we are auto-adding Admins to the betas. Once you've logged in, it will ask you for your name / email. You do not need to sign up with your personal email, as long as you can access your artsy email from your iOS device, you are fine.

</p>

With that done, you should see this:

</p>

Which should _eventually_ send an email invite, this will not be instant, and could be a few days away when we make our next beta. Which is when you'll get the email.

If you have questions and work in Artsy, ask in the #gmv-ios slack room. If you're just interested as an outsider, tweet [@orta](https://twitter.com/orta/) / [@alloy](https://twitter.com/orta/) / [@artsyopensource](https://twitter.com/orta/) and we'll set you up.

_For Developers:_ You can verify who is on the [Artsy Beta here](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/703796080/testflight/information).

## What is Testflight.app?

Testflight is like an App store for your beta invites, you are sent an invite in an email and it will connect your iOS device to our betas. To get started click the big "Start Testing" button. It will take you to the App Store to download the app. You can log in with your normal iTunes account. I'd recommend turning on push notifications.

## OK, what now?

Well, if you've got it all installed, then you can check out the [Using The Emission Beta](using_the_beta.md) page.
